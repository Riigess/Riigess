### Hi there! I'm Riigess /Ree-j-eh-s/.

![Visitors](https://visitor-badge.laobi.icu/badge?page_id=riigess.riigess)

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my startup in the Software Engineering space. Fetchr (a REST API client, server, and automation tool), [Medialytics.app](https://github.com/medialytics-app), and an unannounced AR application are all exciting to me!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Java/Kotlin RESTful APIs, iOS App Development, UI/UX design, and starting my own company that's self-funded.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with learning more about Natural Language Processing, what communities should I join?
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about a time when I was excited to do something new, but knew I had never done something like that before. I think we all find creative ways to engage with new-to-you materials. :)
