### Hi there! I'm Riigess /Ree-j-eh-s/.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Arata, Blue-Moon, and Torch-Drive.. Plus a small hardware engineering project or two.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Machine Learning, object detection, and self-driving vehicles.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Arata, what do communities wish they had for their Discord Server?
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about a time when I struggled that you are currently pushing yourself to learn. I may have been through something similar, or can at least be open about how I would approach the same (or a similar) issue.
